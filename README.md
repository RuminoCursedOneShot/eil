# EIL (Extented Image Library)
Is an open source python image library that is made to replace PILLOW
this library could open those file extensions:
*.raw, *.png, *.jpeg, *.jpg, *.gif, .webp*, .svg*
now, I could only open .raw images because of I am just starting the developpment
this library offers 2 more modules :
convert, that converts an image to an other format*.
transform, for rotate and others
This library also provides filtering algorithms
with this library you can also render a image into a 3d area :)
this lib is also 100% pythonic so nothing is made in C or C++
